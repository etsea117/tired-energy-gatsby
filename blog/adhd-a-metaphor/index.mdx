#### Let's imagine executive function as a bowl of cereal. Every decision that needs to be made, fun or arduous, requires you to eat the whole bowl of cereal.

As a child, you crunched through your cereal when your parents asked you too, but it hurt and you didn't enjoy it. Everyone around you was eating their cereal just fine and didn't seem to be in any pain at all. You told people you didn't like eating the cereal, that it was too difficult, and that it hurt to eat. Teachers and family members insisted that "You just need to try harder to eat the cereal!" but it didn't matter how hard you tried, it still was difficult and painful. Fun activities and enjoyable experiences required multiple bowls of cereal to get through and you never managed to complete them.

As you got older, you realized that everyone else had milk in their cereal which made it possible to eat without pain. You looked in your fridge, but you didn't have any milk there. Everyone else seemed to always wake up with a fresh gallon of milk in the fridge each day, and could eat many bowls of cereal before the milk ran out. You tried to force yourself to eat cereal, but each day you could only get through a couple before the pain was too much and you stopped eating entirely to give your bleeding mouth a rest. Remembering and being able to do homework from school takes more bowls of cereal than you can eat, and your parents and teachers get upset with you. Frustrated with your inability to eat enough cereal, they keep you after school and give you work to do while setting a bowl of cereal in front of you and staring at you while you eat it. "See?" they say, "You can eat cereal just fine! Now just do this yourself every day." You try to explain that you don't have any milk in your fridge, but they don't seem to understand. They are also too proud of themselves for getting you to eat that bowl of cereal to really listen to what you are saying.

Reaching your teenage years, you begin to find ways of imitating the milk. You pour different liquids into your cereal, but that only helps a little and everyone can tell that your cereal is different. You still can't eat as many bowls as everyone else, and society seems to be designed for people who can eat many bowls of cereal every day. You discover that if you pour alcohol in your cereal, it still doesn't taste good and it still hurts, but you don't feel the pain from it as much. It's also easier to handle the embarrassment of not eating as many bowls of cereal as everyone expects you to eat.

After many years, you hear about doctors who specialize in people who struggle to eat cereal. It takes a lot of bowls of cereal to find a doctor near you, schedule an appointment, and remember to go. And this is only possible when you've successfully forced enough bowls of painful cereal down to get and maintain a job which provides health insurance to pay for the doctor. Between first hearing about these doctors and actually being in the first appointment it's been almost 5 years. You talk with the doctor about all of your struggles eating cereal due to not having any milk appear in your fridge each morning. Fortunately, this doctor isn't one of the ones who believe that when you turn 18 you magically start finding milk in the fridge each morning. The doctor tells you that there is therapy specifically designed to help you. He also explains to you that he can authorize you to order a delivery of a half-gallon of milk each morning from a pharmacy nearby. It needs to be authorized because some people, who naturally get a gallon of milk in their fridge each day, are getting extra cartons of milk and chugging them right out of the carton until they get sick or cause problems for others.

Cautiously optimistic, you arrange for the milk delivery. The first day it arrives, you pour yourself a bowl of cereal, fill it with milk, take your first bite, and... Holy Crap! It doesn't hurt! You dance for joy and start to do the things that you've always wanted to do, but were locked behind multiple bowls of cereal. They're not crazy activities, in fact they're activities most people do regularly. But you treasure these activities because now you can actually eat the required amount of cereal without any pain. Reauthorizing the milk deliveries each month is annoying and requires using some of the previous month's milk, but you're happy to do so because it means you can begin to have some semblance of a "normal" life.
